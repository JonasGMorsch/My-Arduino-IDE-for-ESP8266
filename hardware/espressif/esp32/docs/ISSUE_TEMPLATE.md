Make your question, not a Statement, inclusive. Include all pertinent information:

What you are trying to do  
Describe your system (Hardware, computer, O/S, core version, environment)  
Describe what is failing  
Show the shortest possible code that will duplicate the error  
Show the EXACT error message (it doesn't work is not enough)  
Then if someone is interested and knowledgeable you might get a answer.  All of this work on your part shows us that you have worked to solve YOUR problem. The more complete your issue posting is, the more likely someone will volunteer their time to help you.
